# Car-Heater-Package V 1.1.3
Control your car engine heater with Home Assistant

## Description
Designed for and tested with Home Assistant hassio version 0.86.4

 #### Functions:
- 2 sliders to control leaving time
- Shows current time
- Manuel switch to start/stop heater
- switch to activte function
- switch to control if it should be active all week or just weekdays

Its created as a [Home Assistant package](https://home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/) and uses yr as temp sensor but its recommended to use a local temp sensor for batter accuracy.


In the example im using 4 different starting times
- 180 min when colder then -20 degrees Celsius
- 120 min when colder then -10 degrees Celsius
- 60 min when colder then +1 degrees Celsius
- 30 min when colder then +5 degrees Celsius

You can edit the times and temp values to better fit your conditions and heater.

Please note that the automation that checks time/temp is started at 02:00 and you need to change that if you are leaving before 04:00 (this is because they check status every 5th min so don’t want them on all day)
